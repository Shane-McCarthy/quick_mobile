I decided to complete it in Laravel because it was the most recent framework that I have worked with and for time sake I chose it. In review I would have spent more time on the actual shortening of the URL, I think I could be a bit more creative with this. I left the SQL simple and did not save the original SQL that I wrote to create the table.
